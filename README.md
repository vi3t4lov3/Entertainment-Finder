# Entertainment-Finder
Our site has been created as a database to search actors/actresses or movies and be provided with a detailed description, trailer and movie information, and connections to GIFs that are correlated to the searched item to be shared with friends throughout social media. When the user opens the website, they are provided a search bar to place the actors name or title of movie they wish to obtain information on. The results will show the name, picture, and description of the actor or movie, followed by a side column of animated GIF's, and finalized at the bottom with a scroll bar of designated movies for a searched actor and ability to see trailer for searched movie. Our website is beneficial because it filters only the information searched without unnecessary items such as clickbait/advertisement for other movies. This page is user-friendly for anyone searching for a specific actor/movie and wishes to share their interest with others.
